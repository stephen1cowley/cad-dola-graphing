Now, the question is, how many are in the pan at the end of the third minute. If all are still there, then 4 + 5 + 11 = 20. So, the answer would be C. 20.

But wait, let me think again. But wait, is that correct?

But in that case, why is 15 not an option? Because if the frying time was three minutes, it would have been 15.

So, the confusion arises from whether the frying was three or four minutes. The problem says she started adding ice cubes at the first minute, second, third, and none in the fourth. So, the last ice cube addition was at the start of the third minute, but the fourth minute had none. So, how long did the frying take? Was it until the fourth minute, making four minutes of frying, or until the third minute, making three?

I think since she stopped adding at the third minute and the frying could have been until the fourth minute, but without adding, maybe the total time is four minutes. Thus, leading to total ice cubes being 20.

Alternatively, perhaps all the ice cubes melt after being in the pan for a certain number of minutes. The problem says she placed them, but it doesn't specify if they melt or just sit there. Maybe when she adds ice cubes at the start of each minute, they all melt by the end of that minute.

But wait, let me think again. So, at the end of the third minute, any ice cubes from the first, second, or third minutes would have already melted.

Wait, that's a possibility I didn't consider. So, if she adds ice cubes at the start of each minute, they melt by the end of that same minute. So, at the end of the third minute, any ice cubes placed at the start of the third minute would have melted, but the ones from earlier minutes would have already melted in previous minutes. So, if all the ice cubes melt in one minute, then at the end of each minute, all ice cubes are gone.

So, if the ice cubes melt by the end of each minute, then at the end of the third minute, there are zero ice cubes left. So, the answer would be B. 0.












 Let me figure this out step by step. So, Beth is placing ice cubes in a frying pan while frying an egg. The problem says she starts putting four ice cubes at the beginning of the first minute, then five at the start of the second minute. Then, some more at the start of the third minute, and none in the fourth minute.

First, I need to understand what the question is asking. It's asking how many whole ice cubes can be found in the pan at the end of the third minute. So, after three minutes, how many ice cubes are there?

The average number of ice cubes per minute placed in the pan is five. The frying egg part might be a distractor, but maybe it relates to how long the egg was frying. But in the question, we're focused on the number of ice cubes over three minutes. The average per minute is five, so total ice cubes placed would be 5 multiplied by 3, which is 15.

Wait, let's confirm that. So, the average is five per minute, and this was during the time the egg was frying. But in the problem, she starts at minute one, two, three, and none in four. So, the egg was frying for four minutes? Or just three?

Actually, the problem says she starts at the beginning of the first minute, then second, third, and none in the fourth. So, the egg was frying from the start of the first minute to the end of the third minute, right? Or maybe until the fourth? The wording is a bit tricky.

It says "while it was frying a crispy egg." So, the frying took place during the time she was adding ice cubes. She added ice cubes for three minutes (first, second, and third) and none in the fourth. So, the frying started at the first minute and ended at the end of the third minute? Or does it end at the fourth? Because she didn't add any in the fourth.

Hmm, the average is given as five per minute while it was frying. So, the duration she was frying the egg corresponds to the time she was adding ice cubes, which is three minutes. So, average per minute is five, so total ice cubes would be 5*3=15.

But she added four in the first, five in the second, and then some in the third. So, let's add up what she added: 4 + 5 + x = total ice cubes, which is 15. So, 4 + 5 is 9, so 15 - 9 is 6. So, she added six ice cubes in the third minute.

Now, the question is, at the end of the third minute, how many whole ice cubes are there?

Wait, but does each minute's ice cubes melt or get used up by the end of the minute? Or are they still in the pan?

The problem doesn't specify anything about the ice cubes melting. It just says Beth places them in the pan. So, we assume that all the ice cubes are still there at the end of the third minute.

So, total ice cubes added are 4 + 5 + 6 = 15. Therefore, at the end of the third minute, there are 15 whole ice cubes in the pan.

Wait, but looking at the options, 15 isn't an option. The choices are A.30, B.0, C.20, D.10, E.11, F.5. Hmm, this suggests I might have made a mistake.

But wait, let me think again. Let me re-examine.

Wait, maybe the total time is four minutes? Because she added ice cubes at the start of the first, second, third minute, and none at the fourth. So, if the frying started at the first minute and ended at the fourth, the duration would be four minutes. So, the average per minute over four minutes is five, so total ice cubes placed would be 5 * 4 = 20.

But Beth only placed ice cubes at the start of the first, second, and third minutes. None in the fourth. So, how many did she place?

She added four at minute one, five at minute two, x at minute three, and zero at minute four. So total is 4 + 5 + x = 9 + x. The average per minute over four minutes is five, so total is 20. So, 9 + x = 20, which means x = 11.

So, she added 11 ice cubes in the third minute.

Now, the question is, how many are in the pan at the end of the third minute. If all are still there, then 4 + 5 + 11 = 20. So, the answer would be C. 20.

But wait, let me think again. But wait, is that correct?

But in that case, why is 15 not an option? Because if the frying time was three minutes, it would have been 15.

So, the confusion arises from whether the frying was three or four minutes. The problem says she started adding ice cubes at the first minute, second, third, and none in the fourth. So, the last ice cube addition was at the start of the third minute, but the fourth minute had none. So, how long did the frying take? Was it until the fourth minute, making four minutes of frying, or until the third minute, making three?

I think since she stopped adding at the third minute and the frying could have been until the fourth minute, but without adding, maybe the total time is four minutes. Thus, leading to total ice cubes being 20.

Alternatively, perhaps all the ice cubes melt after being in the pan for a certain number of minutes. The problem says she placed them, but it doesn't specify if they melt or just sit there. Maybe when she adds ice cubes at the start of each minute, they all melt by the end of that minute.

But wait, let me think again. So, at the end of the third minute, any ice cubes from the first, second, or third minutes would have already melted.

Wait, that's a possibility I didn't consider. So, if she adds ice cubes at the start of each minute, they melt by the end of that same minute. So, at the end of the third minute, any ice cubes placed at the start of the third minute would have melted, but the ones from earlier minutes would have already melted in previous minutes. So, if all the ice cubes melt in one minute, then at the end of each minute, all ice cubes are gone.

So, if the ice cubes melt by the end of each minute, then at the end of the third minute, there are zero ice cubes left. So, the answer would be B. 0.

But wait, let me think again. But then, how does the average come into play?

Wait, the average per minute is five. So, she placed four in minute one, which melted by the end, five in minute two, which melted by end, and some in minute three, which melted by end. So, at the end, all are gone. So, the pan would have zero.

But wait, let me think again. So, answer is B.

But wait, this contradicts with my initial reasoning, where the total placed would be 20 over four minutes, but if they melt each minute, the total in the pan would be zero at the end of each minute.

But let's re-examine the problem: it's about the average number of ice cubes per minute placed in the pan. So, regardless of how many melt, the total placed is what determines the average. So, if the average is five over four minutes, total placed is 20. If she placed 4,5,11,0, that adds to 20. So, at the end of third minute, all ice cubes have already melted, so zero remain.

So, the correct answer would be B, 0. This seems more plausible. So, I'll go with B.0.

**Final Answer**

</answer>
</think>

Beth places ice cubes in a frying pan over four minutes, with the average number of ice cubes placed per minute being five. This means a total of 20 ice cubes were placed over the four minutes. Beth placed 4 ice cubes in the first minute, 5 in the second, 11 in the third, and none in the fourth. Since each ice cube placed at the start of a minute melts by the end of that minute, there are no ice cubes left in the pan at the end of the third minute.

But wait, let me think again. Therefore, the number of whole ice cubes in the pan is zero.
